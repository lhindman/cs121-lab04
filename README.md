# Lab04 Guide
## Getting Started
Please watch the [Lab04 Walkthough Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbxWwkW_BhyAyktCxjjiuAu-hi5f3AFIh).

### Code Style Requirements
Please review the [CS121 Style Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LWbGQBKkApnNAzzgwOSvRM03DmhYWx5yEfecT2WXfjI/edit?usp=sharing) and apply it in all lab activities and projects this semester. Coding Style will assessed as part of your lab and project grades.

### Code Quality Requirements
- Code must compile without warnings using openjdk11
- Code must run without errors or warnings on safe-path and edge test cases
- More to come as we learn about input validation and exception handling
## Activity 1 - LeapChecker (pp4.1)
### Problem Description
Design and implement an application that reads an integer value representing a year from the user.  The purpose of the program is to determine whether theyear is a leap year (and therfore has 29 days in February) in the Gregorian calendar.  A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, unless it is also divisible by 100 but not 400.  For example, the year 2003 is not a leap year, bu t2004 is.  The year 1900 is not a leap year because it is divisible by 100, but the year 2000 is a leap year because even though it is divisible by 100, it is also divisible by 400. Produce an error message for any input value less than 1582 (the year the Gregorian calendar was adopted).
### Implementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named A1-LeapChecker and create a new file named LeapChecker.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in LeapChecker.java
3. Test the program using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 1 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

## Activity 2 - EvenNumberSum (pp4.3)
### Problem Description
Design and implement an application that reads an integer value and prints the sum of all even integers between 2 and the input value, inclusive. Print an error message if the input value is less than 2. Prompt accordingly.


### Implementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named A2-EvenNumberSum and create a new file named EvenNumberSum.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in EvenNumberSum.java
3. Test the program using the run link above the main method. Carefully think about each of the different cases you'll need to test for to verify that the application is functioning properly.
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 2 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

## Activity 3 - HigherLower Game
### Problem Description
Design and implement an application that plays the Higher / Lower guessing game with numbers. The details for this activity are in the guide below:

### Impementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named A3-HigherLower and open the file named HigherLower.java
2. Modify the existing HigherLower.java program as specified in the HigherLower Activity Guide
3. Test the program using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 3 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.


## Activity 4 - M.A.S.H. Game
### Problem Description
M.A.S.H. is a text-based game that will predict your future!  M.A.S.H. is an abbreviation for the potential future places of residence: Mansion, Apartment, Shack, House. :)  

The details for this activity are in the guide below:

### Impementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named A4-MASHGame and open the file named MASHGame.java
2. Modify the existing MASHGame.java program as specified in the M.A.S.H. Activity Guide
3. Test the program using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 4 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

## Activity 5 - Gradebook
### Problem Description
This activity demonstrates how to handle File I/O and Exception handling in Java by creating a simple Gradebook application. The details for this activity are in the guide below:
